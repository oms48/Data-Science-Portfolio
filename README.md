 -  **Dogs vs Cats : Distinguish images of dogs from cats**
 
 	[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/oms48/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Dogs%20vs%20Cats%20-%20Distinguish%20images%20of%20dogs%20from%20cats/dogOrCat.ipynb)
 
	  In this notebook, I use convolutional neural networks in order to identify there is a cat or dog in an image. I build 2 model from stratch(with 3 convolutional layer - approximately % 90 accuracy - and with 5 convolutional layer - approximately % 94 accuracy -) and also use a pretrained model( InceptionV3 model with weights pre-trained on ImageNet - % 98 accuracy -).  The pictures that I use for training models taken from well-known Kaggle competition : Dogs vs. Cats.

    *Tools : keras*
 -  **Detroit Blight Ticket Compliance**
 
 	[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/oms48/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Detroit%20Blight%20Ticket%20Compliance/Assignment%204.ipynb)
 
    This is the assignment 4 of [Applied Machine Learning in Python ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning) course that  is based on a data challenge from the Michigan Data Science Team (MDST). 
 
    Blight violations are issued by the city to individuals who allow their properties to remain in a deteriorated condition. Every year, the city of Detroit issues millions of dollars in fines to residents and every year, many of these fines remain unpaid. Enforcing unpaid blight fines is a costly and tedious process, so the city wants to know: how can we increase blight ticket compliance?
  
    In this notebook, I build a model that predict whether a given blight ticket will be paid on time. Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) computed for my model is 0.8017.

    *Tools :  pandas, scikit-learn*
 
 -  **NBA Free Throws : Focus on LeBron James**
 
 	[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/oms48/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/NBA%20Free%20Throws%20-%20Focus%20on%20LeBron%20James/kingJames.ipynb)
 
    Analyzing and visualizing free-throw performance of LeBron James. How does LeBron's free-throw performance change over time, at Miami or Cleveland , at home or away, at regular season or playoffs and much more. 
 
    The data used in this notebook can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sebastianmantey/nba-free-throws/data).  
 
    *Tools : R, tidyverse, ggplot2*
 -  **Titanic : Machine Learning From Disaster**
 
 	[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/oms48/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Titanic%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20From%20Disaster/titanic.ipynb)
 
     Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is well-known Kaggle competition that is designed for beginners. In this competition, we have a data set of different information about passengers onboard the Titanic, and we see if we can use that information to predict whether those people survived or not.

 -  **Swiss Style Tournament Planner**
 
 	[Github](https://github.com/oms48/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Swiss%20Style%20Tournament%20Planner)
 
	 This is my final project for [Intro to Relational Databases Udacity Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-relational-databases--ud197).
   
	 In this project, I write a Python Module that uses PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament.
   
	 The game tournament will use the Swiss system for pairing up players in each round : players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible.
   
    *Tools : PostgreSQL*
